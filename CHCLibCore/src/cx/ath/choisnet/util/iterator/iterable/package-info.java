/**
 * Provide some extra Iterator, most based
 * on other Iterator. These Iterator are also Iterable.
 * <br/>
 * An {@link IterableIterator} is an Iterator that could be 
 * restart/reset using {@link Iterable#iterator()}
 * method.
 * <br/>
 * Theses Iterators are design to avoid copy of
 * Collections in memory and to generate result
 * in the flow.
